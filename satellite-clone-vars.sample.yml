############## required variables ####################
# Registration info - Credentials to register your Satellite to Red Hat portal
# - You will need an activation key with a Satellite subscription.
# - For security reasons only Activationkey / Org combination is supported for now.
# - If you don't know how to create Activation keys in https://access.redhat.com, refer
#   to the knowledge base article https://access.redhat.com/articles/1378093.  In this
#   document, there are separate sections for `Creating an Activation Key` and `Finding
#   your Organization ID`.
# - If you want to register your Destination node to the portal by yourself, you can
#   do that and skip the registration part in the playbook run by setting `register_to_portal`
#   to false in this config.
# - `org` field below is the unique Red Hat ID for your organization in portal. It may
#   look like `1111111`.
activationkey: changeme
org: changeme



############## optional variables ####################
#
# The backup folder on your Destination node.
# NOTE: Place the backup files only on the Destination node and not on the Ansible Control node.
#
#   Required backup files:
#   - Standard backup scenario : config_files.tar.gz, mongo_data.tar.gz, pgsql_data.tar.gz, (optional) pulp_data.tar
#   - Online backup or RHEL migration scenario   : config_files.tar.gz, mongo_dump folder, foreman.dump, candlepin.dump
#
#    If the folder mentioned by `backup_dir` does not exist or not accessible, the script will stop with an error.
#
# uncomment the following line to override this option (defaults to /backup)
#backup_dir: /backup

# Misc info
# This defines the minimum free GBs that should be present in your root partition. Update this in accordance with the data present in your Satellite.
#
# uncomment the following line to override this option (defaults to 75)
#required_root_free_space: 75

# Disable firewall - This setting can optionally be used to disable firewall to setup Satellite for testing purposes.
# uncomment the following line to override this option (defaults to false)
#disable_firewall: false

# Run katello-reindex - This setting can optionally be used to run katello reindex after the Satellite install.
# Note: If you are planning to clone your Satellite 6.1 and immediately upgrade to 6.2, you may choose to skip this step.
# A reindex will run automatically if you set include_pulp_data to false
# uncomment the following line to override this option (defaults to false)
#run_katello_reindex: false

# Run pre_install_check
# uncomment the following line to override this option (defaults to true)
#run_pre_install_check: true

# If register_to_portal is set to false:
#   - the host will not be registered to RH portal.
#   - it is the responsibility of the user to make the required repos available.  Otherwise, the script will stop with an error.
# uncomment the following line to override this option (defaults to true)
#register_to_portal: true

# Set this to true if you want to clone a rhel6 Satellite server to a rhel7 machine (defaults to false)
#rhel_migration: false

# Disable postgres triggers. This is set to true to ignore postgresql constraints such as unique indexes
# when restoring the database. This is helpful if the playbook is blocked by errors on the pg_restore command. (defaults to true)
#disable_postgres_triggers: true
#
# Run restorecon step. This will add a step to restore selinux contexts across the fileystem. The backup is restored
# with selinux context, but if selinux issues are still present, this option is useful. (defaults to false)
#restorecon: false
#
# Skip checking that satellite isn't already installed. (defaults to false)
#skip_satellite_rpm_check: false
#
# Overwrite /etc/hosts file. The playbook will overwrite /etc/hosts file with the hostname from the backup files provided. If you
# have a custom /etc/hosts file and do not want it overwritten, you can disable this step and setup the file yourself. If you
# do disable this option, make sure the original Satellite's hostname can resolve to 127.0.0.1 (defaults to true)
#overwrite_etc_hosts: true
