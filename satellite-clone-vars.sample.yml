# Throughout this documentation, ensure that you understand the following terminology:
# - Source server: Existing Satellite server.
# - Target server: new server, to which Satellite server is being cloned to.
# Note:
# 1. All the options mentioned in this file affects only the target server.
# 2. To change any variable, just uncomment the corresponding line and provide a new value.

############## optional variables ####################

# The backup folder on your target server (defaults to /backup).
# Note:
# 1. Place the backup files only on the target server and not on the source server.
# 2. If the folder mentioned by `backup_dir` does not exist or not accessible, the script will stop with an error.
#backup_dir: /backup

# Disable firewall to setup Satellite for testing purposes. (defaults to false)
#disable_firewall: false

# Run katello reindex after the Satellite install. (defaults to false)
# Note: If you are planning to clone your Satellite and immediately upgrade, you may choose to skip this step.
#run_katello_reindex: false

# Run several pre-install checks (defaults to true)
#run_pre_install_check: true

# Automatically register the target server to Red Hat Portal. (defaults to false)
# By default,
#   - The target server will not be registered to the Red Hat portal.
#   - It is the responsibility of the user to make the required repositories available.
# If you override this option, you must update `activationkey` and `org` variables in the next section.
#register_to_portal: false

# Credentials to register the target server to Red Hat portal.
# - Use this section if and only if `register_to_portal` is `true`.
# - You will need an activation key with a Satellite subscription.
# - For security reasons only Activationkey / Org combination is supported for now.
# - If you don't know how to create Activation keys in https://access.redhat.com, refer
#   to the knowledge base article https://access.redhat.com/articles/1378093.  In this
#   document, there are separate sections for `Creating an Activation Key` and `Finding
#   your Organization ID`.
# - `org` field below is the unique Red Hat ID for your organization in portal. It may
#   look like `1111111`.
#activationkey: changeme
#org: changeme

# Enable Red Hat Satellite, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, and Red Hat Software Collections repositories for
# Satellite installation.
# uncomment the following line to override this option (defaults to true). If you override this option, you must make
# sure that the required rpms are available for Satellite installation.
#enable_repos: true

# Run restorecon step (defaults to false) to add a step to restore selinux contexts across the fileystem. The backup is restored
# with selinux context, but if selinux issues are still present, this option is useful.
#restorecon: false

# Disable checking that satellite is already installed. (defaults to false)
#skip_satellite_rpm_check: false

# Overwrite /etc/hosts file (defaults to true). The playbook will overwrite /etc/hosts file with the hostname from the backup files provided. If you
# have a custom /etc/hosts file and do not want it overwritten, you can disable this step and setup the file yourself. If you
# do disable this option, make sure the source server's (original Satellite's) hostname can resolve to 127.0.0.1.
#overwrite_etc_hosts: true

# Disable checking interfaces setup for DHCP and DNS match the interfaces on the target server. (defaults to true)
#check_networking_interfaces: true

# Reset Pulp data, useful for cases where you need to restore a system, but don't have access to the old /var/lib/pulp content.
# Don't enable if you want a 1:1 clone with data. Only for support / development!
#reset_pulp_data: false
