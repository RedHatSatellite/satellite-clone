############## required variables ####################
# Registration info - Credentials to register your Satellite to Red Hat portal
# - You will need an activation key with a Satellite subscription.
# - For security reasons only Activationkey / Org combination is supported for now.
# - If you don't know how to create Activation keys in https://access.redhat.com, refer
#   to the knowledge base article https://access.redhat.com/articles/1378093.  In this
#   document, there are separate sections for `Creating an Activation Key` and `Finding
#   your Organization ID`.
# - If you want to register your Destination node to the portal by yourself, you can
#   do that and skip the registration part in the playbook run by setting `register_to_portal`
#   to false in this config.
# - `org` field below is the unique Red Hat ID for your organization in portal. It may
#   look like `1111111`.
activationkey: changeme
org: changeme
