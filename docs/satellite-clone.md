## Cloning a Satellite server

#### Important Notes ####

  - The playbook will update the cloned Satellite hostname to match the hostname of the original Satellite from which the backup is generated.
  - DHCP, DNS, and TFTP will be disabled during the install to avoid configuration errors. If you want to use provisioning on the cloned Satellite, you will have to manually re-enable these settings after the playbook run.
  - The playbook will reset the admin password to "changeme".
  - The playbook run may may take a while to complete.
  - You can clone RHEL 6 backup data to a RHEL 7 machine.  In this case, you must update the variable `rhel_migration` to true as explained later in this document. Please note that this scenario is supported only for *Satellite 6.2*.
  - If you are using NFS for storage and your pulp backup tar file is large (>150 gb), you might see memory errors while untaring pulp data.  In this case you can optionally choose to skip pulp restore (by setting `include_pulp_data` to `false` in `satellite-clone-vars.yml`).
  - After running the playbook, existing manifests may have to be refreshed.

#### Prerequisites ####

1. You will need files from a katello-backup (`katello-backup` on the `Satellite server`).
   Required backup files:
   - Standard backup scenario : config_files.tar.gz, mongo_data.tar.gz, pgsql_data.tar.gz, (optional) pulp_data.tar
   - Online backup scenario   : config_files.tar.gz, mongo_dump folder, foreman.dump, candlepin.dump, (optional) pulp_data.tar
   - RHEL 6 to 7 migration scenario  : config_files.tar.gz, mongo_data.tar.gz, foreman.dump, candlepin.dump, (optional) pulp_data.tar

   Additional Notes:
   - The playbook will work with or without the pulp_data.tar file from the backup.
   - For cloning RHEL 6 backup data to a RHEL 7 machine: In addition to katello-backup created files, you also need foreman.dump and candlepin.dump.  You may utilize the included script [satellite-clone/helpers/postgresql_dump.sh](../helpers/postgresql_dump.sh) if needed.

2. Make sure that the blank machine has adequate space and also make sure that the root partition has all the storage space. You may utilize the included script [satellite-clone/helpers/reallocate.sh](../helpers/reallocate.sh) if needed. The ansible playbook run will fail if the free space in root partition is less than the value specified in `required_root_free_space` variable in `satellite-clone-vars.yml`

#### Instructions ####

1. Create file `satellite-clone-vars.yml` (by copying `satellite-clone-vars.sample.yml` found in the root of the project) and update the required variables.

   ```console
     # cp satellite-clone-vars.sample.yml satellite-clone-vars.yml
   ```
2. Place the backup files in a folder on the blank machine. This folder path is specified in the `backup_dir` variable in `satellite-clone-vars.yml`.
3. Update the folder path of the backup files using the `backup_dir` variable in `satellite-clone-vars.yml`.
4. If you are cloning RHEL 6 backup data to a RHEL 7 machine, update the variable `rhel_migration` to true in `satellite-clone-vars.yml`.
5. Run the ansible playbook from the root directory of this project:

    ```console
      # ansible-playbook satellite-clone-playbook.yml
    ```
