## Changing the Hostname of a Satellite host
### **NOTE: This script must be used for Satellite 6.2 only**
#### On the Satellite host
1. Before you run the hostname change playbook, you have to make a manual change to the default capsule's hostname. Log into UI and rename the default capsule (under infrastructure->capsules) to the new hostname using both the name and url fields.

#### On the Control node
1. Update the required sections in [roles/change_hostname/vars/main.yml] (../roles/change_hostname/vars/main.yml).
2. Update the `inventory` file under the root of this project to add your Satellite host's ip address. If executing the playbook on localhost, add `ansible_connection=local` after the IP address
3. Run the ansible playbook:

    ```console
      # ansible-playbook -i inventory satellite-hostname-playbook.yml
    ```
4. If you have a capsule you will need to reregister it with RHSM and then run the following (replacing `<capsule-hostname>` with your capsule's hostname):

   ```console
     # capsule-certs-generate --capsule-fqdn '<capsule-hostname>' --certs-tar '~/<capsule-hostname>-certs.tar'`
   ```
Then follow the output generated by the capsule-certs-generate command
