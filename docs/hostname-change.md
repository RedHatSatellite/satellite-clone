## Changing the Hostname of a Satellite server

### **Important warnings - read before running this playbook**
 - This script must be used for Satellite 6.2 only
 - All capsules and satellite clients will have to be re-registered with Red Hat Subscription mananger, and capsules will have to be reinstalled after running this playbook

#### On the Control node
1. Create file `roles/change_hostname/vars/main.yml` by copying `roles/change_hostname/vars/main.sample.yml` and update it as necessary.
2. Update the `inventory` file under the root of this project to add your Satellite machine's ip address. If executing the playbook on localhost, add `ansible_connection=local` after the IP address
3. Run the ansible playbook:

    ```console
      # ansible-playbook -i inventory satellite-hostname-playbook.yml
    ```
4. The output generated by the katello-change-hostname command can be found in change-hostname.log. There will be further steps to complete post hostname change detailed there.
