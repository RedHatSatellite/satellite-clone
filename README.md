# Satellite-clone

Easily set up a Red Hat Satellite server with restored backup data.

## Getting Started
Throughout this documentation, ensure that you understand the following terminology:
- Source server: Existing Satellite server.
- Target server: new server, to which Satellite server is being cloned.

#### Supported Satellite Versions ####
- 6.5
- 6.6
- 6.7
- 6.8

#### What you need: ####
  - A blank (vanilla install) RHEL 7 server (target server). You will run the setup commands here.
  - A backup from a Satellite server (source server) created with `satellite-maintain`. This backup can be with or without pulp data, and can be from a RHEL 6 or 7 machine.
  - You will need a Satellite 6 subscription for the cloned machine. With the new Satellite Infrastructure [subscription model](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3382781) you should have multiple Satellite subscriptions available.

#### Setup ####

On the target server:

1. git clone this project.
   ```console
     # git clone https://github.com/RedHatSatellite/satellite-clone.git
   ```

2. Install `ansible` package.  Ansible should be installed from extras channel.
   ```console
     # subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
     # yum install -y ansible
   ```

Now you can proceed to performing the [cloning process](docs/satellite-clone.md). Please check our [FAQ section](docs/faqs.md) for frequently asked questions.
